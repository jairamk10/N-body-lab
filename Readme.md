This small repository is the output of the work obtained during the hands-on experience of the N-body lab taught at LMU by [Prof. Klaus Dolag](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/~dolag/).

N-body lab is part of the Numerical Lab taught at the University Observatory, Munich (Department of Physics, Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, Germany)

More details about the tutorials and the references for codes can be found on this [repository by Johannes Stoiber](https://github.com/Johannes-Stoiber/Nbody_lab)
